  <b>RISK FACTORS</b></h1>
</div>
    <h4>Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes.</h4>
<ul>
    <h2>Risk factors for type 1 diabetes</h2>
Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include:<br>

    <li><h3>Family history.</h3> Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes.</li>
    <li><h3>Environmental factors. </h3>Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes.</li>
    <li><h3>The presence of damaging immune system cells</h3> (autoantibodies). Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes.</li>
    <li><h3>Geography.</h3> Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes.</li>
    <br><h2>Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes</h2>
Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including:<br>

    <li><h3>Weight.</h3> The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin.</li>
    <li><h3>Inactivity.</h3> The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.</li>
    <li><h3>Family history.</h3> Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.</li>
    <li><h3>Race.</h3> Although it's unclear why, people of certain races — including black people, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans — are at higher risk.</li>
    <li><h3>Age.</h3> Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults.</li>
    <li><h3>Gestational diabetes.</h3> If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes later increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes.</li>
    <li><h3>Polycystic ovary syndrome.</h3> For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes.</li>
    <li><h3>High blood pressure.</h3> Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.</li>
    <li><h3>Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels.</h3> If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good," cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are.</li>
    <h2>Risk factors for gestational diabetes</h2>
Any pregnant woman can develop gestational diabetes, but some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include:<br>

    <li><h3>Age.</h3> Women older than age 25 are at increased risk.</li>
    <li><h3>Family or personal history.</h3>Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth.</li>
    <li><h3>Weight.</h3> Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk.</li>
        <li><h3>Race.</h3> For reasons that aren't clear, women who are black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.</li><br></ul>
