 <b>Myth:</b>You must avoid sugar at all costs.<br>
<b>Facts:</b> You can enjoy your favorite treats as long as you plan properly and limit hidden sugars. Dessert doesn’t have to be off limits, as long as it’s a part of a healthy meal plan.<br><br>

<b>Myth:</b> You have to cut way down on carbs.<br>
<b>Facts:</b> The type of carbohydrates you eat as well as serving size is key. Focus on whole grain carbs instead of starchy carbs since they’re high in fiber and digested slowly, keeping blood sugar levels more even.<br><br>

<b>Myth:</b> You’ll need special diabetic meals.<br>
<b>Facts:</b>The principles of healthy eating are the same—whether or not you’re diabetic. Expensive diabetic foods generally offer no special benefit.<br><br>

<b>Myth:</b> A high-protein diet is best.<br>
<b>Facts:</b>Studies have shown that eating too much protein, especially animal protein, may actually cause insulin resistance, a key factor in diabetes. A healthy diet includes protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Our bodies need all three to function properly. The key is a balanced diet.</font></p></div><br><br>
