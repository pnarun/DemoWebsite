  <b>SYMPTOMS</b></h1>
</div>
<h4><ul>Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not experience symptoms initially. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.<br>

Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are:<br>

    <li>Increased thirst</li>
<li>Frequent urination</li>
<li>Extreme hunger</li>
<li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
<li>Presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin)</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Blurred vision</li>
<li>Slow-healing sores</li>
<li>Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections</li><br>
Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.<br>

    <h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
    <li>If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin.</li>
    <li>  If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize.</li></ul></h4>
